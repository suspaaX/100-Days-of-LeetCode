Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.

A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.

A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.

Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".
Example 2:

Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["KFC","Shogun","Burger King"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The common string with the least index sum is "Shogun" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
Example 3:

Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".
